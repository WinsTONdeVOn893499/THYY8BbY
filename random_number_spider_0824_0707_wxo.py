# Note that this is a simple script that uses the Scrapy framework's structure
# for organizing the code. However, since Scrapy is intended for web scraping
# and not random number generation, this script only serves as a basic example.
# To use Scrapy for its intended purpose, you would typically define a Scrapy spider
# and other components like Item, Pipeline, etc., which are not present here.
