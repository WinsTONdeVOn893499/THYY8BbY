"""
Access Control Scrapy Spider - A Scrapy spider for managing access control.

This spider is designed to handle access control tasks, such as verifying permissions,
managing roles, and ensuring that users have the necessary clearance to access
specified resources.

Attributes:
    None

Methods:
    start_requests(self): Starts the scraping process by yielding requests.
    parse(self, response): Handles the response from the server and extracts necessary data.

Example:
    >>> spider = AccessControlSpider()
    >>> spider.start_requests()

Note:
    This spider assumes that the necessary middleware and settings are configured
    properly in the Scrapy project.
