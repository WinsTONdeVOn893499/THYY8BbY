Search Algorithm Optimization using Scrapy

This module contains a Scrapy spider designed to optimize search algorithms.
It is structured to be clear, maintainable, and scalable, with proper error handling.

# To run the spider, use the Scrapy command line tool:
# scrapy crawl search_algorithm -a setting=VALUE
